// The HTML code defines a simple calculator with a display and buttons for numbers, operators, clear, and equals. 
It also includes a section for displaying the calculator history.

The CSS code defines styles for the calculator buttons, display, and history section. 
The button styles include a font size, padding, margin, border radius, background color, box shadow, and cursor pointer. 
The hover state changes the background color to a slightly darker shade. 
The display style sets a font size, padding, margin, width, text alignment, border, background color, and box shadow. 
The history style sets the list style to none and removes any margins or padding. 
The history item style sets a font size and margin bottom. 
These styles can be adjusted to fit your desired aesthetic.

The JavaScript code defines functions for handling button presses and managing the calculator history. 
When a number button is pressed, the corresponding digit is appended to the display value. 
When an operator button is pressed, the current display value is added to the memory array along with the operator. 
When the clear button is pressed, the display is cleared and the memory array is reset.
When the equals button is pressed, the current display value is added to the memory array, and the entire expression is evaluated using the eval() function. 
The result is displayed in the display, added to the memory array with the equals sign, saved to local storage, and displayed in the history section.
